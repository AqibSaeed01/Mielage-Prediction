# Mielage Prediction
The "Mileage Prediction - Regression Analysis" project is about creating a smart tool that can guess how many miles a vehicle can travel using a certain amount of fuel. Imagine you want to know how far different cars can go before they need more gas. This project uses clever calculations and data to make an educated guess. It looks at things like the car's size, weight, and how powerful its engine is. By doing this for lots of cars, we can help people choose cars that use fuel more efficiently. It's like having a mileage fortune teller that helps you pick a car that goes a long way on a single tank of gas!
